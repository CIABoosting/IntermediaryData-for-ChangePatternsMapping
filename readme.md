# Introduction
This is a repo storing the intermediary data for TSE articles 'Change-Patterns-Mapping'

# Overview
There are two datasets,  **data** and **experiment_data**.

<br/>

The file named **data** stores the datasets we use to find similar change-patterns. 
In each commit of projects, there are two files:

- **coreclass.txt**: show the probability of classes to be coreclass and the class with highest probability is the coreclass
- **CouplingReult.txt**: show the coupling dependencies between two classes. Change-pattern between two classes is an 18-dimension vector and each dimension represents a kind of coupling dependencies as indicated at section 4.3 in our article

<br/>

The file named **experiment_data** stores the datasets that we use to conduct experiments.
In each commit of projects, there are up to five files:

- **coreclass.txt**: show the probability of classes to be coreclass and the class with highest probability is the coreclass
- **CouplingReult.txt**: show the coupling dependencies between two classes. Change-pattern between two classes is an 18-dimension vector and each dimension represents a kind of coupling dependencies as indicated at section 4.3 in our article
- **ImpactminerResult**: stores the original impacted classes generated by the tool 'Impactminer'
- **JripplesResult**: stores the original impacted classes generated by the tool 'Jripples'
- **RoseResult**: stores the original impacted classes generated by the tool 'Rose'



<br/>

**Notice**: Not every commit has 'ImpactminerResult', 'JripplesResult' and 'RoseResult'. 

For Impactminer, it is because the commit lacks commit message or the tool can't find results according to the commit message given.

For Jripples, it is because the coreclass in a particular commit has no dependencies with other classes in the project.

For Rose, it is because the coreclass hasn't appeared in previous commits.
