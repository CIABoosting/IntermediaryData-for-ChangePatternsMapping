# Introduction
This is a repo storing the intermediary data for TSE articles 'Change-Patterns-Mapping'

# Overview
There are two datasets,  **data** and **experiment_data**.

<br/>

The file named **data** stores the datasets we use to find similar change-patterns. 
In each commit of projects, there are two files:

- **coreclass.txt**: show the probability of classes to be coreclass and the class with highest probability is the coreclass
- **CouplingReult.txt**: show the coupling dependencies between two classes. Change-pattern between two classes is an 18-dimension vector and each dimension represents a kind of coupling dependencies as indicated at section 4.3 in our article

<br/>

The file named **experiment_data** stores the datasets that we use to conduct experiments.
In each commit of projects, there are up to five files:

- **coreclass.txt**: show the probability of classes to be coreclass and the class with highest probability is the coreclass
- **CouplingReult.txt**: show the coupling dependencies between two classes. Change-pattern between two classes is an 18-dimension vector and each dimension represents a kind of coupling dependencies as indicated at section 4.3 in our article
- **ImpactminerResult**: stores the original impacted classes generated by the tool 'Impactminer'
- **JripplesResult**: stores the original impacted classes generated by the tool 'Jripples'
- **RoseResult**: stores the original impacted classes generated by the tool 'Rose'

<br/>
**Notice**: Not every file has 'ImpactminerResult', 'JripplesResult' and 'RoseResult', due to lack of commit message, dependencies with other files and appearance in previous commits respectively.
